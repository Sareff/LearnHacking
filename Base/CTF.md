	- ctb - crack the box
	- reverse (pwn) - reverse engineering of programs without source code
	- stegano -steganography
	- ppc - professional programming and coding
	- crypto - cryptography
	- web - web vulnerabilities tasks, like SQL Injection, XSS and so on
- classic - In the classic scheme, each team gets a dedicated server or small network to maintain its functioning and protection. During the game, teams receive points for the correct operation of their server services and for stolen information (flags) from the opponent's servers. Usually, after the end of the competition, the participating teams publish their solutions on their websites, so that you can always familiarize yourself with the solution to the problem of interest.
